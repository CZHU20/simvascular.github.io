# SimVascular Website (compiled branch)

This is the repository for the SimVascular website

# Usage

All edits should be made in the **source** branch. DO NOT edit the **master** branch directly.

The master branch is generated by building the source branch, using ruby, according to the instructions below. The generated files should then be pushed to the master branch. The website will automatically detect the changed master branch and update itself.

### Simvascular Website Project

```
$ sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev

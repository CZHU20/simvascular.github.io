Dave Parker is the lead software engineer for SimVascular. He received his Ph.D. in Biomechanical Engineering from Stanford University. While at the Georgia Institute of Technology he completed his B.S. in Computer Science and did graduate work in Applied Mathematics, concentrating on research in fractals and nonlinear dynamics. Prior to joining Stanford, he worked on various scientific and engineering software projects involving molecular simulation and visualization, analysis of next generation DNA sequencing data, simulating thermo-plastic deformations for 3D metal printing processes, finite element simulations of shock wave propagation in complex materials, and scientific visualization. While in Charles Taylor's lab he developed software for image-based modeling of the human vasculature for patient-specific computational blood flow simulations.

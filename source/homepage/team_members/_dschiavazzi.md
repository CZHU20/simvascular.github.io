Daniele Schiavazzi is a post-doctoral researcher at the University of California, San Diego. He graduated with honors from the University of Padova and pursued a Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from the same University. He was awarded a visiting researcher appointment from the Uncertainty Quantification Lab at Stanford University during his Ph.D. and, more recently, an AHA post-doctoral fellowship. His main research interests are in numerical simulation and finite element analysis, forward uncertainty propagation using sparse multi-resolution representations, inverse Bayesian estimation and use of computational models to inform clinical decision making under uncertainty. He is a keen tennis player and cross-country ski enthusiast.

# SimVascular workshop @ WCB 2018, July 8th

## Registration

Attendance is free for WCB attendees, however please RSVP [here](https://goo.gl/forms/2WcLThZbf0vvyH892)

## Workshop Description

SimVascular is the only available open source software package that provides a complete pipeline from medical image data to cardiovascular blood flow simulation and analysis. It offers capabilities for image segmentation, unstructured adaptive meshing, and physiologic boundary condition application. SimVascular contains an efficient Navier-Stokes finite element solver with fluid structure interaction. An accompanying vascular model repository provides over 100 clinical data sets with simulation results from different parts of the vasculature to enable research. Extensive online documentation and tutorials with clinical examples are provided online (www.simvascular.org).

We will interactively take new users through a step-by-step tutorial of the entire software pipeline. Newly added features for image processing and 3D segmentation will be highlighted and demonstrated in detail. Following the interactive demonstrations, we will moderate a question and answer session for current and potential users.

Attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop and install the software ahead of time [SimVascular Download](http://simvascular.github.io/#download).

# SimVascular Workshop and New User Training @ SB3C 2019, June 25th

## Workshop Description

SimVascular is the only fully open source software package providing a complete pipeline from medical image data to cardiovascular blood flow simulation results and analysis (www.simvascular.org).  It offers capabilities for image segmentation, unstructured adaptive meshing, physiologic boundary conditions, and two Navier-Stokes finite element solvers with fluid structure interaction capabilities, including large deformation motion with an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation.  An accompanying vascular model repository provides over 100 clinical data sets with simulation results from different parts of the vasculature to enable research.  Extensive online documentation and tutorials with clinical examples are provided online.

In this workshop, we will interactively take new users through a step-by-step tutorial, covering basic steps of model construction, meshing, flow simulations, and best practices for high quality results. We will also introduce several new features of SimVascular, including a module for image segmentation with machine learning, a python scripting interface, and a pipeline for reduced-order modeling with a 1D solver.  Following a series of interactive demonstrations, we will moderate a question and answer session for current and potential users.

Attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop and install the software ahead of time [SimVascular Download](http://simvascular.github.io/#download).

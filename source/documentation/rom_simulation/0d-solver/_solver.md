# 0D Solver #

0D models are analogous to electrical circuit systems, where flow rate represents current and pressure represents voltage. Resistance portrays the viscous effects of blood flow, capacitance represents the compliance and distensibility of the vessel wall, and inductance represents the inertia of the blood flow.

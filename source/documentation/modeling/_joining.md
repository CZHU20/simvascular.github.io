Joining Vessels Together to Create a Model

Once you’ve finished creating the right iliac branch, you will find that it is quite easy to join it to the aorta and make a solid model.

In the group treeview display window, select the groups that you would like to use to create a model and click on the “Use Groups” button under “Solid Model Lofting” to the right of the group treeview display window. Once you have chosen the groups you would like to include in your model (one for the aorta, one for the right iliac), they should have “YES” written next to them in the “Use in Lofting” column of the group treeview display.

Under the “ Parasolid → Create Model” tab, click on the “Create Pre-Op Solid” button. In the field next to “Save Model”, type in a model name, keeping the “.xmt_txt” file extension intact. Click on the “Save Model” button.

If you would like to view the model you have just created, clear the 3D display window by clicking on the “Window” drop-down menu and selecting “Clear Window”.

Under the “Solids” tab, select the “View Model” tab. Next to “Solid Model Object”, pull down the menu where it says “None” and select “Preop Solid”. Your joined model should now appear in the 3D display window.

If you zoom into the bifurcation area of the model, you will find the seam where the two solids were united. You will learn how to smooth out this seam in the next section.

###Using Level Sets to Define a Contour

Thresholding is very dependent on the user-specified parameters and does not always result in a closed contour.  An alternate method that’s been implemented within **SimVascular** is the level set method.  The basic idea is to segment images using both intensity values and geometric constraints. For the purposes of our model-building exercise, we will be using level-set and segmentation by hand followed by “fit-circle” to create the final model. Thus, please follow the instructions for saving the contours for this exercise.

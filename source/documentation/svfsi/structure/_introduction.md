## Cardiac Mechanics Modeling using **svFSI**

Modeling cardiac mechanics is a challenging task as the heart muscle is a complex fibrous structure that is predominantly incompressible <a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>, and undergoes large deformation during a cardiac cycle. **svFSI** is designed specifically to tackles all these challenges. It has a robust implementation of nonlinear FEM for large deformation problems and several advanced fiber-reinforced hyperelastic material models. In the following sections, we will demonstrate **svFSI**'s capability in modeling cardiac mechanics using the benchmark example from Land et al. <a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>, i.e., the passive inflation of an idealized left ventricle. We will also briefly explain the theory and implementation of nonlinear continuum mechanics in **svFSI**.

# Getting Started 

###Introduction

This guide provides begining users with the basic knowledge needed to get started using SimVascular. 
The <a href="#introduction"> Introduction </a> describes important SimVascular concepts, its GUI and basic functionality. 
A <a href="#tutorial"> Tutorial</a>  then follows demonstrating the steps in the SimVascular image-based modeling pipeline, 
from medical image data segmentation to patient specific blood flow simulation. A model of an aorta and two iliac 
arteries is created from medical imaging data.  A finite element mesh is then generated from the model and used in a 
CFD simulation to simulate blood flow in the arteries. 

Another useful resource for learning how to use SimVascular are the

of recent videos demonstrate all the steps in the modeling pipeline presented in the <a href="#tutorial"> Tutorial</a> below. 

Images taken of the

# Getting Started Guide

###Introduction
This quick start guide first gives a brief introduction to some of the important SimVascular concepts, its GUI and basic functionality. 
A tutorial then follows demonstrating the steps in the SimVascular image-based modeling pipeline, from medical image data 
segmentation to patient specific blood flow simulation. A model of an aorta and two iliac arteries is created from medical imaging data. 
A finite element mesh is then generated from the model and used in a CFD simulation to simulate blood flow in the arteries. 

We will use images taken of the

to illustrate certain concepts throughout the guide.

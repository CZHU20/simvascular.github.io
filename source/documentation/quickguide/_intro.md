SimVascular is an interactive application used to created patient-specific geometric models of human vasculature from 3D medical
imaging data aquired for a specific anatomical region. These models are then used as the basis for blood flow simulations using 
various numerical methods. The sequence of steps used by SimVascular to do this is called the image-based modeling pipeline. 

The SimVascular graphical user interface (GUI) is used to interactively manage each step in the image-based modeling pipeline. 
The <a href="#gui"> GUI </a> provides different graphical elements (e.g. buttons) used to input the data required to generate 
the output (e.g. geometric model) of each step. The display of image and geometical data in a grapics window can be interactively
controlled using the mouse. Information from image and geometical data can also be queried using the mouse and allows selecting,
for example, a point in 3D space

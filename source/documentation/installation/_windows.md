### Installing SimVascular ###

1. Install SimVascular 

2. SimVascular still provides the old GUI. If you want to launch SimVascular with the old GUI:

		Right click on the SimVascular icon on the desktop.
		Add "-tcl" to the very end of the "Target:" command line, for example:
			"C:\Program Files\SimVascular\sv\yyyy-mm-dd\simvascular-bin.exe "Tcl/SimVascular_2.0/simvascular_startup.tcl -tcl"
		Or
		Copy the original icon and make such change so you have one icon for the new GUI and the other for the old GUI.

3. To access the full functions of SimVascular Simulation tool, it's required to install svSolvers. There is a separate installer for svSolvers at simtk.org

4. For **Windows 7**, you may need to install a few extra package to use SimVascular.

## Pre-processing: **svPre**

The **SimVascular** pre-processor **svPre** is an application that reads the topological information on the finite element model and associated boundary conditions and produces two files that can be processed by **svSolver**. These files are:

- **geombc.dat.1**, that contains the topology of the finite element model and prescribed boundary conditions. 

- **restart.0.1**, that contains the initial state of the model.

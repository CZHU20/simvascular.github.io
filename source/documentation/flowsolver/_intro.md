## Introduction

**svSolver** solves the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in an arbitrary domain that in general is represented by a vascular model reconstructed from image data. This is a complex subject due to the many aspects involved in it, and therefore this document will focus mainly on the practical sides of the various steps of the analysis.

From a historical standpoint, the **svSolver** has evolved from the academic finite element code PHASTA (this stands for Parallel, Hierarchical, Adaptive, Stabilized, Transient Analysis), developed mainly at RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY) by Professor Kenneth Jansen. This code is in turned inspired by the Stabilized Finite Element theory developed by Professor Thomas J.R. Hughes during his Stanford years. As pointed above, the main features of the original PHASTA code are: 

- **Parallel**: using the MPI communication protocol (Message Passing Interface), the code is able to run analysis on multiple processors, either on Shared-Memory supercomputers, computer clusters, workstations, or regular PC desktops. The scalability of the code (i.e., the ability to make use of a large number of processors without significant losses in efficiency) has been proven up to several thousand processors.

- **Adaptive**: the code has mesh-adaptivity capabilities that make possible to generate highly anisotropic finite element meshes based on an error field computed from the finite element solution. Having mesh adaptation tools is a really important feature, since it helps to improve the quality of the numerical solution while keeping the finite element mesh size “under control”.

- **Stabilized**: the code uses a Stabilized finite element formulation (more  specifically, a SUPG formulation: Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin) that allows for equal-order interpolation of the pressure and velocity fields, while maintaining numerical stability in both the diffusive and advective-dominated limits.

- **Transient**: the code uses a time integration algorithm based on the $\alpha$-method. This is an implicit, second-order accurate, unconditionally stable (for linear systems) algorithm with user-defined level of desired numerical dissipation. On top of these features originally present in the PHASTA code, Professor Charles Taylor’s group at Stanford University developed a number of important additions in the areas of Boundary Conditions and Fluid-Solid Interaction (FSI) coupling. These additions are crucial to represent with a high level of realism the way blood flows in arteries, since this flow - which can be reasonably assumed to be incompressible - is highly dependent on the characteristics of the vascular trees that are downstream of our three-dimensional model, and the compliance of the three-dimensional vascular tree.

This document will teach you the fundamentals of:

1. Preparing the necessary svSolver input files (**Pre-processing**)
2. Running a flow analysis (**Solution**)
3. Looking and providing interpretation to the results generated by the code (**Post-processing**)

In addition, this tutorial will show you how to use some of the adaptivity tools **!!!**, and will also show you a number of good practices that are important to observe during the simulation process. We will do this considering very simple geometries (a straight cylinder, an idealized bifurcation **!!!**, and an idealized aneurysm **!!!**) to illustrate different points in a simple way.

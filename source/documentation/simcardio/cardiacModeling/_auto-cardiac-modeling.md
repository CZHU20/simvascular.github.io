# Cardiac Geometric Modeling Tool 

The SimVascular **Cardiac Geometric Modeling Tool** is used to extract major cardiac structures from time-resolved imaging data
using automatic machine learning techniques. Volumetric meshes created from segmentation geometry are registered with image
data to extract heart wall motion that can be later used in multi-physics simulations of the heart using the **svFSI** solver.

The **Cardiac Geometric Modeling Tool** is implemented as the <b>sv_auto_lv_modeling</b> Python package included with the SimVascualar
application.

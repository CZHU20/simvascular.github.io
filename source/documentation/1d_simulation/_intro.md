# Introduction #

The SimVascular **1D Simulation Tool** is used to interactively create the geometry, boundary conditions and solver 
parameters needed to execute a **sv1DSolver** simulation. The **sv1DSolver** solves for blood pressure and flow 
in deformable one-dimensional hemodynamic networks. These equations offer a relatively efficient means to reproduce 
realistic wave propagation phenomemon in vascular networks. One-dimensional networks can be coupled to both 0D lumped 
parameter models and to more complex 3D flow simulations as boundary conditions.

The following sections describe how to use the **1D Simulation Tool** to create one-dimensional hemodynamic networks 
from 3D vascular models and simulate them using the **sv1DSolver** .

# Case 3 - Coronary Normal #

##Clinical Significance 

Coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., causing about 25% of total deaths in the U.S. Coronary artery stenosis and occlusion is caused by plague build up, often fatty materials resulting in atherosclerosis, in the arteries supplying blood to heart muscle resulting in ischemia. Coronary Artery aneurysms are also caused by atherosclerosis or other disease; however coronary artery aneurysms are less common with incidence varying from 1.5-5%. The most common sites for coronary aneurysms, in order of highest to lowest frequency are the: (1) proximal Left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA), (2) left main coronary artery (LMCA), (3) left circumflex artery (LCX), (4) and lastly the junction between the RCA and right posterior descending artery (RPD). Understanding blood flow may serve as the basis for understanding coronary artery disease and aneurysm formation and considering therapeutic options.
